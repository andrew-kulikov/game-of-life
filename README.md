Js implementation of Conway's Game of Life

##### Goal: 
Main goal is Build a frontend app that implements Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

##### The game
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

## Basic functionality:
* Start / stop game
* Controls for different game parameters 
* Possibility to change spawn patterns 

## More functionality:
* Game levels
* AI based algorithm that tries to win the game
* User accounts
* Leaderboard

## Technologies:
* React
* Redux
* Sass
* Tensorflow.js (?)
